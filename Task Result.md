In my project i used Python 3 as a main coding language because it offers a lot of simple to use methods and according guides to it to realize the task.

I used also inbuilt modules to work with the CSV files such as CSV and OS to check the existenz of file.

3rd Party libraries:
Matplotlib. I have decided to use this one only because it offers a possibility to visualize the data with a pre-finished schema and it also simple to use
